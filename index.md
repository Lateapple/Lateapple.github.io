## The Plan!

This page marks the start of my journey to learn how to code. Although I have previously taught myself HTML and CSS. I will be pursuing languages such as C++, Python and SQL.

During my learning, I will look to create small games or applications which will be available for you to download and play around with.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Lateapple/Lateapple.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
